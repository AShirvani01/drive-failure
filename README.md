# Drive Failure Risk Factors
This repository contains my final project and code for STA475: Survival Analysis @ UofT. 
Python and SQL was used to compile and store the data. Analysis was done in R. The final project was in the form of an infographic.
## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the risk factors (brand and
capacity) associated with time to drive failure.

## Acknowledgements
The data used in this analysis was sourced from [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data),
an open cloud storage company that publishes survival data on the drives in their data centers.
